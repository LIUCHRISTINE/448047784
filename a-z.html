                    Apatosaurus achieved its colossal size by eating plants rather than meat. It may have used its long tail as a whip to protect itself from predators.

                <td>Troodon was a small, bird-like dinosaur of the Late Cretaceous Period. It grew to around 2 metres (6.5 ft.) in length, and would have stood waist-high to a man.

                    Despite its small size, troodon was well armed. It had sharp teeth, clawed fingers, and an enlarged, sickle-shaped claw on each of its feet. This intelligent dinosaur was fast, agile, and equipped with good eyesight.</td>

                <td>Tyrannosaurus is perhaps the most famous type of dinosaur in the world, and no list of dinosaurs would be complete without it! One species in particular, Tyrannosaurus Rex, is particularly well-known as being the archetypal ‘killer dinosaur’.

                    Tyrannosaurus is one of the largest land-based meat-eaters of all time. Not only was it strong; it was also intelligent, fast, and equipped with excellent senses of both sight and smell.
                    
                    One feature of tyrannosaurus is its huge skull. The skull would have been able to support large jaw muscles, giving tyrannosaurus a powerful bite.
                    
                    Tyrannosaurus grew to around 12 metres (40 ft.) in length, and weighed up to 8 metric tonnes (9 short tons). It lived right to the end of the Cretaceous Period, becoming extinct along with all of the other non-bird dinosaurs in the Cretaceous-Paleogene Extinction Event.</td>

                <td>Velociraptor was a small, bird-like, predatory dinosaur of the late Cretaceous Period. Its name–which means ‘swift plunderer’–accurately describes this speedy, fierce carnivore.

                    Velociraptor was armed with sharp teeth and sharp claws. Its most fearsome weapons were the large, curved inner claws on either foot. These were probably used not only for slashing and ripping, but also to grab and restrain the velociraptor’s unfortunate prey.
                    
                    In many films, velociraptor is portrayed as being taller than a man. In real-life, however, it would have been waist-high at most. It may also have been fully feathered.</td>
